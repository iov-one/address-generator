# IOV Address Generator

Generates addresses for the IOV blockchain.

## Use hosted

The app is hosted at https://iov-one.github.io/address-generator/. Please note that various attacks
are possible against hosted passphrase generators and the safest way to generate a passphrase using
this tool is to download the source code and run it locally on a machine which is not connected to
the internet (see below).

## Use locally

1. `git clone https://github.com/iov-one/address-generator.git && cd address-generator`
2. `yarn install && yarn start`
3. Open http://localhost:3000/ in a modern browser (this step does not require an internet
   connection)
